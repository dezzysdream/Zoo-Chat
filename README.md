# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Dantes Nava**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Zoo** Introducing Zoo! It is like Zoom Chat but for Animals that work in Corporate. Animals are able to schedule calls, join groups (aka a pride or pack), and eat treats!

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ü¶¶ü¶Åüêâ**
